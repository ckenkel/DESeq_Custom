Short Guide 
-----------

1. Put all this into the same directory:
	- script: DESeq.R, gomwu_a.pl, gomwu_b.pl, gomwu.functions.R
	- GO hierarchy file 
		(version 1.0, http://www.geneontology.org/GO.downloads.ontology.shtml)
	- table of gene annotations for your sequences: two-column (gene identifier <tab> gene name), 
		tab-delimited, one line per gene. 
	- table of read counts by gene (see tag-based_RNAseq repository for how to generate this file) 
		values: gene id, continuous measure of significance such as log(fold-change) or

2. Make sure you have R installed. The R part requires additional packages, which 
you might need to install prior to running this method. Directions are provided in the .R script

3. Open DESeq.R script; edit the input file names, mark and execute bits of code
separated by blank lines one by one. Follow instructions given as comments in the script.
